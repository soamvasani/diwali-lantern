# Diwali Lantern

This is a design for a Diwali lantern, or
[Kandeel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandeel).

Traditionally, these lanterns are made of wood, paper, string, and
glue.  ith laser cutting widely available, I wanted to experiment
with making the frame of the lantern using cardstock and a laser.

This design is meant to be cut out of cardstock or a similar
material. If you do not have easy access to a laser cutter, you can
use [ponoko.com](ponoko.com) to make this; that's what I used.

As Ponoko (and perhaps other laser cutters) require, the design uses
blue lines to cut and red lines to score the paper.

## Scale

The same design is shared in two scales, one a large size meant for
Ponoko's 12"x24" paper and a smaller one meant for using half of
Ponoko's 18"x18" paper.

## Assembly

You can easily glue together cardstock to assemble it. The design
includes tabs to allow easy gluing. Add some colorful translucent
paper behind the frame (again, by gluing it to the frame) to make it
look like one of the example lanterns on
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandeel).
